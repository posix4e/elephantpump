JSONCDC provides change data capture for Postgres, translating the Postgres
write ahead log to JSON.

It is written in Rust and, being short, is a good skeleton project for other
would be plugin authors who'd like to use Rust to write Postgres extensions.

Our library Requires rust stable 1.1 or greater.

JSONCDC is available under multiple licenses:

* the same license as Postgres itself (`licenses/postgres`),

* the Apache 2.0 license (`licenses/apache`).


Status
------

JSONCDC is presently installable with `pgxn`, from the unstable channel:
`pgxn install jsoncdc --unstable`.


Usage
-----

A basic demo:

    SELECT * FROM pg_create_logical_replication_slot('jsoncdc', 'jsoncdc');
    --- Wait for some transactions, and then:
    SELECT * FROM pg_logical_slot_get_changes('jsoncdc', NULL, NULL);

The output format of `jsoncdc` is very regular, consisting of `begin`,
`table`, `insert`, `update`, `delete` and [`message`][1]
clauses as JSON objects, one per line:

    { "begin": <xid> }
    { "schema": <column names and type>, "table": <name of table> }
    ...inserts, updates and deletes for this table...
    { "schema": <column names and type>, "table": <name of next table> }
    ...inserts, updates and deletes for next table...
    { "prefix": <prefix>, "message": <message>, "transactional": <true|false> }
    ...messages may be mixed in at any point; they don't belong to a table...
    { "commit": <xid>, "t": <timestamp with timezone> }

With `pg_recvlogical` and a little shell, you can leverage this very regular
formatting to get each transaction batched into a separate file:

    pg_recvlogical -S jsoncdc -d postgres:/// --start -f - |
    while read -r line
    do
      case "$line" in
        '{ "begin": '*)                # Close and reopen FD 9 for each new XID
          fields=( $line )
          xid="${fields[2]}"
          exec 9>&-
          exec 9> "txn-${xid}.json" ;;
      esac
      printf '%s\n' "$line" >&9       # Use printf because echo is non-portable
    done
